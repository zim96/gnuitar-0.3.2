<h1><a name=about>What is GNUitar ?</a></h1>

<p>GNUitar is a real-time sound effects software that allows 
you to use your computer as a guitar processor. It has GTK+ based 
interface. It can be compiled on any flavor of UNIX that have
GTK+ 1.2, Glib, pthreads and OSS sound driver. It also works on Windows.
Program is inspired by 2 works:<ul>

<h1><a name=requirements>Requirements</a></h1>

<p>You will need:<ul>
<li>GTK+ version 1.2.6 or better; also we support now GTK+ 2.x branch;
<li>GLIB 1.2 or better</li>
<li>POSIX threads on UNIX</li>
<li>full-duplex sound card</li>
<li>To compile: GCC on UNIX, Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or 7.0 on Windows</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name=performance>Performance</a></h1>

<p>GNUitar is a CPU-consuming program. Pentium/166 is sufficient
to run GNUitar, Pentium II/300 is recommended, and on Pentium II/450
it will work just fine.
Real performance is very depend on your CPU/sound card/sound driver/OS
combination. The best performance can be achieved on Linux,
because of its great real-time features and advanced OSS sound drivers.

<p>When running the program, make sure you close all unnecessary applications,
to give more resources to it. Avoid anything that can cause disk I/O
or CPU usage.

<p>GNUitar runs with increased priority; this may cause hang-ups
and delayed system response on low-end machines. Therefore you
should care to save all important data in other applications,
before you launch GNUitar.

<h2><a name=perf_unix>Performance - UNIX notes</a></h2>

<p>GNUitar executable file should be setuid root to process sound with 
real-time priority; otherwise you'll hear glitches and delays while 
switching between windows. It switches to real user id as soon as 
it set real-time priority to effect-processing thread, and before
any GTK initializations are being performed, so it shouldn't break 
security on your system.
GNUitar has a latency of about 4-8ms on Linux/Pentium II/450/AWE64 ISA !

<h2><a name=perf_windows>Performance - Windows notes</a></h2>

<p>Windows have complex problems with latency when processing audio in real time,
mostly because of its non-uniform drivers architecture. 
GNUitar latency on Windows is much higher than on Linux. The real latency
is very depend on sound board driver.
<p>GNUitar for Windows has two playback methods:
<ul>
<li>Playback via MME</li>
<li>Playback via DirectSound</li>
</ul>
<p>The first method uses the standard MME API (functions waveOut*()).
The second method requires DirectX to be installed and uses DirectSound
for playback. The method can be switched from the sampling parameters dialog,
by checking/unchecking the "Playback via DirectSound" checkbox.
<p>DirectSound playback shows the best results that are almost close to
Linux performance. The MME playback exists for compatibility purposes,
and for another reason. If a driver is not optimized for DirectSound,
Windows will automatically emulate DirectSound output using the MME devices.
If a WDM driver is used (see below), DirectSound support is not implemented
by the driver developer but by the operating system. MME playback support exists
specially for this case, when the output via DirectSound is emulated by OS.

<h3>Windows Sound Drivers Overview</h3>
<p>There are few kinds of sound drivers for Windows: old VXD (Win95/98),
NT4-kernel style, and modern WDM drivers that were introduced in Windows 98/SE.
AFAIK WDM drivers provide much lower latency. Therefore, avoid VXD drivers; 
use modern WDM drivers instead, if possible.

<p>The difference in latency between two kinds of drivers is really noticeable:
I had 100ms up to ~400ms on Pentium III/850/ISA AWE64/VXD/MME playback,
and ~60ms on Pentium MMX/166/Yamaha OPL3/WDM/MME playback laptop.
Try to start/stop sound few times, if the initial latency is bad.

<p>The kind of bus (PCI/ISA) of the sound card does not affect
the latency very much, the deal is with OS and its architecture.
So do not through away your old ISA Sound Blaster and replace it with
modern sound card, first try it on Linux !

<h2><a name=latency_control>How To Control Latency</h2>
<p>The latency can be controlled with a high degree from the GNUitar interface.
There is a settings dialog that can be called from the
<i>Options->Sampling Parameters</i> menu (or by <i>Ctrl-P</i>).
There is an option called "Fragment Size". The greater is the fragment size,
the greater is the latency, BUT... You might want to increase fragment size
on low-end computers, to decrease the system load and number of buffer overruns
(drops). The buffer overrun is the immediate result of the bad performance.
Buffer overruns have a hearable effect of a scratches, sometimes
periodic (ten overruns per second produce a 10 Hz tone).
<p>General notes on how to achieve the best performance:
<ul>
<li>The lower is the sampling rate, the better is the latency. Drawback is
the sound quality.</li>
<li>The lower is the fragment size, the better is the latency. Drawback is the
higher system load.</li>
<li>The hearable periodic scratches (DirectSound output) can be fixed
by decreasing the overrun threshold (sampling params dialog).</li>
<li>Increase the fragment size and decrease the sampling rate on
low-end CPU, to gain the best latency/overruns/load ratio.</li>
<li>On Windows, prefer WDM drivers, if possible. Try both MME and
DirectSound playback; choose which is the best.</li>
<li>Prefer Linux over Windows. Properly tuned Linux kernel has 10-100 times 
better latency on the same hardware.</li>
<li>Make gnuitar executable setuid root on UNIX, to allow it run with
increased priority.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name=install>Installation</a></h1>

See <a href=install.html>INSTALL</a> file for common installation notes.

<h1><a name=gui>Interface and Controls</a></h1>

<p>There are 3 areas in the main window. The right area is a list of all
available effects. The central area contains effects that are currently used.
There are few buttons right to it should be used to add/remove effects 
and change its order. Each effect has separate top-level control window with 
appropriate sliders.  Each effect-control box is shown in the window manager
task bar.

<p>The left area contains available effect layouts, or presets, and button
to add the one. Layout is a "snapshot" of your effects and its' 
settings, you can load/save using "File" menu.

<p>Big "Switch" button is used to switch layouts. In this manner,
you can change current sound by one mouse/keyboard click.

<p>Big "START/STOP" button is used to start/stop playback.
You may want to press it few times if you experience buffer overruns
or broken sound output.

<p>You can write track of what you play to a file. Just click
check-box "Write track" at the bottom of program window, enter 
filename and play. Don't forget that continuous track write 
can fill out your hard drive.
The track file format is raw data, word length, signed
(the sampling rate and mono/stereo are controlled from the sampling parameters
dialog). You can convert it with SoX program like this<br><pre>

    sox -w -s -c 1 -r 44100 track.raw track.wav, 

</pre>
and then to MP3:
<pre>

    bladeenc track.wav

</pre>
Sox is available at <a href=http://home.sprynet.com/~cbagwell/sox.html target=top>
    http://home.sprynet.com/~cbagwell/sox.html</a>, 
and Bladeenc is at <a href=http://home8.swipnet.se/~w-82625 target=top>http://home8.swipnet.se/~w-82625</a>.

<p>Windows users can write track directly to .wav file
(currently it is not available on UNIX).

<h1><a name=effects>Effects</a></h1>

The controls and description of the effects follow below.

<h2><a name=autowah>Autowah</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>speed    - speed of wah-wah'ing</li>
<li>freq.low - low frequency (the cycle starts from this freq.)</li>
<li>freq.hi  - high frequence (the cycle stops at this freq.)</li>
<li>mix      - mix clean sound with processed sound</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=reverb>Reverberator</a></h2>

Reverberator produces echoed "space" sound. Controls:
<ul>
<li>delay  - delay time</li>
<li>wet    - "wet" (processed) sound volume</li>
<li>dry    - "dry" (clean) sound volume</li>
<li>regen  - number of repeats</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=delay>Delay</a></h2>

Another kind of reverberation.
<ul>
<li>decay  - this controls how the repeated sound is fading out</li>
<li>time   - this is the delay time</li>
<li>repeat - number of repeats</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=distort>Distortion</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>distort    - power of effect</li>
<li>level      - volume, for the case if you need to mute it quickly</li>
<li>saturation - high-frequency "sand" in the sound</li>
<li>lowpass    - low-band filter that can be used to change the sound feel</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=vibrato>Vibrato</a></h2>

<p>Vibrato sounds like when you turn the master volume on and off very quickly
(few times per second).
<ul>
<li>speed     - the speed of modulation</li>
<li>amplitude - the depth of modulation</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=chorus>Chorus</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>depth     - the depth of modulation</li>
<li>speed     - the speed of modulation</li>
<li>wet       - "wet" (processed) sound volume</li>
<li>dry       - "dry" (clean) sound volume</li>
<li>regen     - hard to explain</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=echo>Echo</a></h2>

<p>Another reverberation effect, not like the others.
While other reverb effects are just kinds of sound patterns repeating,
echo attempts to achieve a large hall echo.
<ul>
<li>decay     - this controls how the repeated sound is fading out</li>
<li>count     - number of repeats</li>
<li>size      - controls delay time</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=distort2>Distortion 2</a></h2>

<p>Another cool distortion. Emulates Ibanez TS9 pedal.

<ul>
<li>drive      - power of effect</li>
<li>lowpass    - low-band filter that can be used to change the sound feel</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=noise>Noise Gate</a></h2>

<p>Simple noise reduction effect.<br>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTES:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Should be used <b>BEFORE</b> the distortion.</li>
<li>If you want to achieve a note slight attack (fade in),
    you must increase the Hold time as much as possible.
    Otherwise with the low Attack time and low signal you
    the effect will be constantly false triggered, therefore
    breaking the fadein effect</li>
</ul>

<p>Controls are:
<ul>
<li>threshold    - minimal volume of the sound required to pass signal
                   to the output.</li>
<li>hold         - if the signal is below threshold during this time,
                   it will be muted. Should be as low as possible.
		   Simply - it is an effect triggering time.</li>
<li>release time - if the signal is below threshold, the playback
                   is not muted immediately but fades out this time instead</li>
<li>attack       - if the signal is above the threshold, it will fade in
                   this time. Ususally should be 0, but having it
		   non-zero will produce interesting effect just like the
		   violin sound.</li>
<li>hysteresis   - the threshold required to turn off the playback when
                   it is already asound (the regular threshold affects
		   only the growing signal, while hysteresis
		   affects fading signal). Should not be larger than
		   the threshold.</li>
</ul>
